// *********** LeetCode Hard Questions ***********

// ***** Activity 1: Median of Two Sorted Arrays *****
/*
    * Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of integers and returns the median of the two sorted arrays. 
    * Log the median for a few test cases, including edge cases.
*/



// ***** Activity 2: Merge k Sorted Lists *****
/*
    * Write a function that takes an array of k linked lists is sorted in ascending order, and merges all the linked lists into one sorted linked list. 
    * Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list.
*/



// ***** Activity 3: Trapping Rain Water *****
/*
    * Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, and computes how much water it can trap after raining.
    * Log the amount of trapped water for a few test cases. 
*/



// ***** Activity 4: N-Queens *****
/*
    * Write a function that places n queens on an nXn chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, and returns alldistinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
    * Log the distinct solutions for a few test cases.
*/




// ***** Activity 5: Word Ladder *****
/*
    * Write a function that takes a begin word, an end word, and a dictionary of words, and finds the length of the shortest transfromation sequence from the begin word to the end word, such that only one letter can be changed at a time and each transfomed word must exist in the word list. 
    * Log the length of the shortest transformation sequence for a few test cases.

// *********** LeetCode Medium Questions ***********

// ***** Activity 1: Add Two Numbers *****
/*
    * Write a function that takes two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stroed in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
    * Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the sum as a linked list.
*/




// ***** Activity 2: Longest Substring without Repeating Characters *****
/*
    * Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
    * Log the length for a few test cases, including edge cases.
*/



// ***** Activity 3: Container With Most Water *****
/*
    * Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a line drawn at each point. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container holds the most water.
    * Log the maximum amount of water for a few test cases.
*/




// ***** Activity 4: 3Sum *****
/*
    * Write a function that takes an array of integers and finds all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero.
    * Log the triplets for a few test cases, including edge cases.
*/



// ***** Activity 5: Group Anagrams *****
/*
    * Write a function that takes an array of strings and groups anagrams together.
    * Log the grouped anagrams for a few test cases.
